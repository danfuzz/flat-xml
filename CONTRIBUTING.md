Contributing to Flat-XML
------------------------

Bug reports and patches gladly accepted at
<https://github.com/danfuzz/flat-xml>.

Please be maximally specific with your bug reports. In particular,
please note what OS and version you are running. In addition, the
specific versions of the `bash` and `awk` tools may come in handy.

The gold standard for a bug report includes a pull request which
adds a test that demonstrates the problem. The platinum standard
includes a PR with both a test and a fix.

Thanks!
